[*]When all data has been deleted the panel will now properly reset.
[*]You can now choose to hide the background for the live window
[*]You can no longer save or load fights multiple times. The save button will be greyed out for fights which are already among the saved fights, when trying to load a fight which is already loaded you will jump to the fight instead.
[*]Skills are now coloured by skill type. (note that this feature only works for new fights. Saved fights which were recorded previously will still shop up in the old way)
[*]Sometimes long-term buffs were shown to have been active > 100% even if they were active all the time. This has been fixed to a degree but might still appear due to lag. (Thanks to @Scootworks for reporting)
[*]Attempted to fix an issue with Blade of Woe causing problems with dps calculation
[*]Attempted to fix an issue where "empty" fights were being recorded. 
[*]Attempted to fix an issue where the addon gets "stuck" in calculations

Version 0.5.10 6,774 (02.07.2016, 1:12)
[*]Fixed an issue where the addon was still "stuck" in calculations for people who experienced this before the fix in version 0.5.8 and couldn't resolve it since (e.g. by resetting the SavedVariables).
[*]Added a slash command to toggle the main window.

0.6
[*]Added tracking of group buffs and debuffs that you apply to an enemy (It looks to me like it is not possible to track debuffs applied from group members)
[*]Added detailed tracking of resource drain/gain effects 
[*]Added two more layouts for the live report ("Horizontal" and "Vertical"), in addition to the standard one which is called "Compact". 
[*]Added several debug options. Most of them should not be needed for the average player but they might help in identifying bugs/problems.
[*]Added a scaling option for the live report window
[*]Added a scaling option for the fight report window
[*]Added little info tooltips to explain the function of the buttons (hope I didn't miss any)
[*]Added Major Force, Weapon Enchant Procs and some Set Procs to the Buffs tracking. They had to be added manually because, the tracking for them works different than for the other Buffs, which can be tracked directly via the API. Those Effects were taken from Srendarr, big thanks to @Phinix, check out his fantastic Addon if you haven't)
[*]Changed the way DPS is posted. There also is a new option which posts Boss DPS in bossfights and the Sum DPS in all other fights.
[*]Added API Compatibility for the Shadows of the Hist DLC (I have run a Dungeon without problems but I didn't thoroughly test everything yet)
[*]updated LibAddonMenu to version 2.0r20.2

0.6.4 15,863 (15.08.2016) 00:30

0.6.5 ?????? (05.10.2016) 13:40
[*]API Bump to One Tamriel

[*]Fixed a bug where resource and stat data were not shown in the combat log when the fight was loaded from saved fights.
[*]Fixed a bug where permanent buffs were not shown in the buff recap. 
[*]Note: Combat Metrics got moved to Combat Addons since a lot of things are working quite good, I'd say. 
[*]Note: Some entries in the Outgoing (De-)buffs tab are clearly not related to the player (The passive boni from repentance, Warhorn.. ). Since I have no good way to filter them without impairing functionality I'll leave it as it is. 

0.6.7 31,533 (24.10.2016) 22:40
[*]Updated Japanese Translation

0.6.8 36,363 (01.11.2016) 21:09

0.6.12
[*]Removed tracking of effects for other units than the player. This removes debuff tracking for now. This was necessary since all debuff events are broadcasted now which lead to performance issues.

0.6.13 79,843 (08.02.2017) 22:48
[*]Added a workaround for "better" buff tracking. It's a bit weird, but probably a bit better. You'll see.

0.6.14 90,681 (15.02.2017) 23:55
[*]While we further wait for the API patch, I implemented a few fixes for stuff that stopped working due to the API change issue. (Group heal/incoming DPS not shown, Fight reset @ Mage ..)

0.6.18 105,371 (20.02.2017) 21:57
[*]Changed buff tracking so it should behave more or less like before the Homestead update, with one exception: Enemy debuffs are now tracked globally (so they don't reflect your contribution but the one from the whole group. In a future update I will try to display both)

0.6.19 116,137 (02.03.2017) 00:00
[*]Added some bugfixes to buff tracking (duplicate events, some buffs not showing)
[*]Added some slash commands to post dps: /CMX dps, /CMX sdps, /CMX mdps, /CMX alldps for automatic, single-target, multi-target or single + multitarget DPS respectively. /CMX hps to post HPS

0.6.20 130,016 (19.03.2017) 14:27
[*]Small fixes

0.6.21 201,864 (22.05.2017) 22:40
[*]API Bump to Morrowind (100019)
[*]Added warning for upcoming update: At the end of this week, between May 26th and May 28th a new, almost completely rewritten update for Combat Metrics will be released. Due to changes to the data structure, it is neccessary to reset all data. Maybe make a backup or some screenshots of you favorite fights.

0.7.0 218,717 (28.05.2017) 23:41
[*]Rewrote major parts of the code to improve performance and efficiency. This resulted in a new data structure which makes it neccessary to reset alls saved data, including saved fights and your settings.
[*]Most of the things are still the same (just done differently in the background) so don't expect any larger changes.
[*]I will rework the UI code next. I don't plan to change much, but feel free to send me any ideas or comments regarding the interface.
[*]Posting damage to chat can now be done anytime and is no longer affected by the current calculation status of the fight. You won't accidentially post low DPS numbers anymore.
[*]Fights will no longer be calculated after the end of the fight. They now will get calculated when you attempt to view them the fight report. The progress of the calculation is now shown, so you no longer have to wonder if the addon got stuck. The calculation is now faster, and also uses a more aggresive setting that might cause minor frame drops.
[*]Support for stackable buffs: Each number of stacks will show up as a separate buff. This potentially increases the number of buffs. I have ideas how to improve that in the future.
[*]Support for group buffs: Buff uptime is given for group and player separately. 
[*]DPS or HPS in the unit window is now shown as the damage per second between the first and the last hit or heal to that unit. This means, the total DPS/HPS will not be the sum of the individual unit DPS/HPS.
[*]Fights are now saved accountwide so you can review them on any of your chars. The overview shows the Character that you played with in the fight. 
[*]Since the introduction of group buffs tracking in Homestead, fights are quite large so only a few could be saved before reaching the file size limit (64MB). If you normally save a fight now by clicking the save button you will no longer save the combat log. This allows to save a lot more fights. If you wish to save a fight including the log, press Shift+Click. This is also explained by the tooltip.

0.7.1 226,373 (30.05.2017) 01:34

0.7.6 307,157 (27.07.2017) 21:43
[*]Fixed issue that could trigger a lua error under rare conditions

0.7.7 321,451 (05.08.2017) 18:40
[*]Replaced workaround for Minor Magickasteal with a proper fix. This was not a bug by ZOS, but a mistake in my code.

[*]Fixed an issue where group detection failed.

0.8
[*] Combat Metrics can now be found on Github: https://github.com/Solinur/CombatMetrics. 
[*] The UI has been completely rewritten. It still works the same for most parts, but the code behind it is cleaner and more performant. Hopefully I didn't introduce too many bugs :D.
[*] Reworked the system how fights are stored. A seperate "Sub-Addon" (CombatMetricsFightData) is used for this, so it uses it own file in the SavedVariables folder. When saving a fight it will check if it can be safely stored. An error message will appear if there is not enough space.
[*] Added a setting to specify the maximum memory for saving fights. (note: this sets the memory of the data in game, which doesn't have to match the size of the file in your SavedVariables folder.)
[*] Added Character Info to the report panel
[*] Added the current version of the ESO client to the report panel (lower right)
[*] Added "Critical Damage Done" to the respective stats panels. (Separately for Spell/Weapon Attacks)
[*] Added "Spell Penetration" and "Physical Penetration" to the respective stats panels. It will update based on the targets selected in the unit panel. A Setting in the settings menu allows you to change the assumed resistance of your targets and the assumed value for crusher as I cannot read it from the API.
[*] Reworked how average values of stats are calculated. Before all damage effects would be used to weight the stats. Now magicka related stats are only weighted by magicka damage effects. "Critical Damage Done" is only weighted by crits.
[*] Buffs and Debuffs cast before the start of the fight will now be tracked.
[*] The fight label can now be edited. Just double click it!
[*] Added an option to prioritize keeping boss fights when deleting recent fights due to reaching the limit.
[*] Added an option to mark buffs/debuffs as favourite. Just right-click on one in the buff panel. They will then be shown on the top of the List.
[*] The fightlist (when you "load" a fight) shows a few more bits of information about the fight, like zone, character, time. Depending on the Selected Category, (e.g. "Damage Caused", "Healing Done") DPS or HPS will be shown.
[*] Fixed an issue where the name of the fight was not set in the fightlist if the fight had not been calculated yet.
[*] Fixed an issue when a unit and a debuff were selected that nothing got shown in the combat log.
[*] Added an option to change opacity of the live report.
[*] Added an option to lock the position of the live report.
[*] Added an internal parameter called hpstime. This allows to calculate the HPS based of the time you have been healing, while DPS can be calculated based on the time you did damage. In the live report window the bigger one of the two will be shown. In the main report the active time will reflect hpstime when a healing category is selected. This should also address an issue where refreshing path would cause your dps to lower at the end of the fight despite nothing really happening anymore.

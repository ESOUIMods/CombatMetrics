[*]When all data has been deleted the panel will now properly reset.
[*]You can now choose to hide the background for the live window
[*]You can no longer save or load fights multiple times. The save button will be greyed out for fights which are already among the saved fights, when trying to load a fight which is already loaded you will jump to the fight instead.
[*]Skills are now coloured by skill type. (note that this feature only works for new fights. Saved fights which were recorded previously will still shop up in the old way)
[*]Sometimes long-term buffs were shown to have been active > 100% even if they were active all the time. This has been fixed to a degree but might still appear due to lag. (Thanks to @Scootworks for reporting)
[*]Attempted to fix an issue with Blade of Woe causing problems with dps calculation
[*]Attempted to fix an issue where "empty" fights were being recorded. 
[*]Attempted to fix an issue where the addon gets "stuck" in calculations

[*]Attempted to fix a bug that caused the game to crash after bossfights with multiple enemies.

Version 0.5.10 6,774 (02.07.2016, 1:12)
[*]Fixed an issue where the addon was still "stuck" in calculations for people who experienced this before the fix in version 0.5.8 and couldn't resolve it since (e.g. by resetting the SavedVariables).
[*]Added a slash command to toggle the main window.

0.6
[*]Added tracking of group buffs and debuffs that you apply to an enemy (It looks to me like it is not possible to track debuffs applied from group members)
[*]Added detailed tracking of resource drain/gain effects 
[*]Added two more layouts for the live report ("Horizontal" and "Vertical"), in addition to the standard one which is called "Compact". 
[*]Added several debug options. Most of them should not be needed for the average player but they might help in identifying bugs/problems.
[*]Added a scaling option for the live report window
[*]Added a scaling option for the fight report window
[*]Added little info tooltips to explain the function of the buttons (hope I didn't miss any)
[*]Added Major Force, Weapon Enchant Procs and some Set Procs to the Buffs tracking. They had to be added manually because, the tracking for them works different than for the other Buffs, which can be tracked directly via the API. Those Effects were taken from Srendarr, big thanks to @Phinix, check out his fantastic Addon if you haven't)
[*]Changed the way DPS is posted. There also is a new option which posts Boss DPS in bossfights and the Sum DPS in all other fights.
[*]Added API Compatibility for the Shadows of the Hist DLC (I have run a Dungeon without problems but I didn't thoroughly test everything yet)
[*]updated LibAddonMenu to version 2.0r20.2

[*]fixed some issues with the UI scaling (e.g. slider bars hiding some numbers)

0.6.4 15,863 (15.08.2016) 00:30
[*]implemented japanese translation (if someone wants to do other translations, just go ahead ;) )

0.6.5 ?????? (05.10.2016) 13:40
[*]API Bump to One Tamriel

0.6.6 29,869 (23.10.2016) 23:21

[*]Fixed a bug where resource and stat data were not shown in the combat log when the fight was loaded from saved fights.
[*]Fixed a bug where permanent buffs were not shown in the buff recap. 
[*]Note: Combat Metrics got moved to Combat Addons since a lot of things are working quite good, I'd say. 
[*]Note: Some entries in the Outgoing (De-)buffs tab are clearly not related to the player (The passive boni from repentance, Warhorn.. ). Since I have no good way to filter them without impairing functionality I'll leave it as it is. 

0.6.7 31,533 (24.10.2016) 22:40
[*]Updated Japanese Translation

0.6.8 36,363 (01.11.2016) 21:09

[*]Added the possibility to replace ability names or icons. Refer to the addon description for more details
[*]Outgoing Damage that gets absorbed by a shield now contributes towards total damage.

[*]The combat will now reset when The Mage leaves its throne. 
[*]You can now manually reset the fight (via Keybind or by typing "/cmx reset"). Use with caution, as it may cause issues.

[*]Add setting to disable group damage monitoring in large groups

[*]Replaced the delete icon. (It was confused with one indicating to close a window)
[*]API Bump to Homestead (100018)

0.6.12
[*]Removed tracking of effects for other units than the player. This removes debuff tracking for now. This was necessary since all debuff events are broadcasted now which lead to performance issues.

0.6.13 79,843 (08.02.2017) 22:48
[*]Added a workaround for "better" buff tracking. It's a bit weird, but probably a bit better. You'll see.

0.6.14 90,681 (15.02.2017) 23:55
[*]While we further wait for the API patch, I implemented a few fixes for stuff that stopped working due to the API change issue. (Group heal/incoming DPS not shown, Fight reset @ Mage ..)

0.6.15 92,620 (16.02.2017) 10:31
[*]Fixed a critical error introduced in last patch. 

0.6.16 97,770 (17.02.2017) 21:14

[*]fixed missing icons

0.6.18 105,371 (20.02.2017) 21:57
[*]Changed buff tracking so it should behave more or less like before the Homestead update, with one exception: Enemy debuffs are now tracked globally (so they don't reflect your contribution but the one from the whole group. In a future update I will try to display both)

0.6.19 116,137 (02.03.2017) 00:00
[*]Added some bugfixes to buff tracking (duplicate events, some buffs not showing)
[*]Added some slash commands to post dps: /CMX dps, /CMX sdps, /CMX mdps, /CMX alldps for automatic, single-target, multi-target or single + multitarget DPS respectively. /CMX hps to post HPS

0.6.20 130,016 (19.03.2017) 14:27
[*]Small fixes

0.6.21 201,864 (22.05.2017) 22:40
[*]API Bump to Morrowind (100019)
[*]Added warning for upcoming update: At the end of this week, between May 26th and May 28th a new, almost completely rewritten update for Combat Metrics will be released. Due to changes to the data structure, it is neccessary to reset all data. Maybe make a backup or some screenshots of you favorite fights.

0.7.0 218,717 (28.05.2017) 23:41
[*]Rewrote major parts of the code to improve performance and efficiency. This resulted in a new data structure which makes it neccessary to reset alls saved data, including saved fights and your settings.
[*]Most of the things are still the same (just done differently in the background) so don't expect any larger changes.
[*]I will rework the UI code next. I don't plan to change much, but feel free to send me any ideas or comments regarding the interface.
[*]Posting damage to chat can now be done anytime and is no longer affected by the current calculation status of the fight. You won't accidentially post low DPS numbers anymore.
[*]Fights will no longer be calculated after the end of the fight. They now will get calculated when you attempt to view them the fight report. The progress of the calculation is now shown, so you no longer have to wonder if the addon got stuck. The calculation is now faster, and also uses a more aggresive setting that might cause minor frame drops.
[*]Support for stackable buffs: Each number of stacks will show up as a separate buff. This potentially increases the number of buffs. I have ideas how to improve that in the future.
[*]Support for group buffs: Buff uptime is given for group and player separately. 
[*]DPS or HPS in the unit window is now shown as the damage per second between the first and the last hit or heal to that unit. This means, the total DPS/HPS will not be the sum of the individual unit DPS/HPS.
[*]Fights are now saved accountwide so you can review them on any of your chars. The overview shows the Character that you played with in the fight. 
[*]Since the introduction of group buffs tracking in Homestead, fights are quite large so only a few could be saved before reaching the file size limit (64MB). If you normally save a fight now by clicking the save button you will no longer save the combat log. This allows to save a lot more fights. If you wish to save a fight including the log, press Shift+Click. This is also explained by the tooltip.

0.7.1 226,373 (30.05.2017) 01:34
[*]Added a fix for the "Turn off in Cyrodil" setting
[*]Added a fix to correctly hide the Live Report Window according to the respective setting

0.7.6 307,157 (27.07.2017) 21:43
[*]Fixed issue that could trigger a lua error under rare conditions
[*]Added (most likely temporary) workaround for Minor Magickasteal. Every magicka regeneration tick that is exactly 300 is attributed to Minor Magickasteal for now.

0.7.7 321,451 (05.08.2017) 18:40
[*]Replaced workaround for Minor Magickasteal with a proper fix. This was not a bug by ZOS, but a mistake in my code.

0.7.8 335,653 (13.08.2017) 20:40
[*]API Bump to Horns of the Reach (100020)
[*]Fixed some leaked global variables.

0.7.12 463,274 (20.01.2018) 21:31

0.7.13 480,303 (26.01.2018) 23:14

0.7.13 487,180 (27.01.2018) 21:04
[*]Fixed an issue where group detection failed.

0.8.0 (beta)
[*] Combat Metrics can now be found on Github: https://github.com/Solinur/CombatMetrics. 
[*] The UI has been completely rewritten. It still works the same for most parts, but the code behind it is cleaner and more performant. Hopefully I didn't introduce too many bugs :D.
[*] Reworked the system how fights are stored. A seperate "Sub-Addon" (CombatMetricsFightData) is used for this, so it uses its own file in the SavedVariables folder. When saving a fight it will check if it can be safely stored. An error message will appear if there is not enough space. The new storage system is way more efficient for fights where you want to store the full combat log.
[*] Added a setting to specify the maximum memory for saving fights. (Note: this sets the memory of the data in game, which usually doesn't match the size of the file on your harddisk in your SavedVariables folder.)
[*] Added character info (class, race) to the report panel (top left)
[*] Added the current version of the ESO client to the report panel (lower right)
[*] Added "Critical Damage Done" to the respective stats panels. (Separately for Spell/Weapon Attacks)
[*] Added "Spell Penetration" and "Physical Penetration" to the respective stats panels. It will update based on the targets selected in the unit panel. An entry in the settings menu allows you to change the assumed resistance of your targets and the assumed value for the Crusher debuff as it cannot be read from the API.
[*] Reworked how average values of stats are calculated. Before all damage effects would be used to weight the stats. Now magicka related stats are only weighted by magicka damage effects. "Critical Damage Done" is only weighted by crits.
[*] Buffs and Debuffs cast before the start of the fight will now be tracked.
[*] The fight label can now be edited. Just double click it!
[*] Added an option to prioritize keeping boss fights when deleting recent fights due to reaching the limit.
[*] Added an option to mark buffs/debuffs as favourite. Just right-click one in the buff panel. Favourite buffs will be shown on the top of the List.
[*] The fightlist (when you "load" a fight) shows a few more bits of information about the fight, like zone, character, time. Depending on the Selected Category, (e.g. "Damage Caused", "Healing Done") DPS or HPS will be shown.
[*] Fixed an issue where the name of the fight was not set in the fightlist if the fight had not been calculated yet.
[*] Fixed an issue where nothing got shown in the combat log if a unit and a debuff were selected.
[*] Added an option to change opacity of the live report.
[*] Added an option to lock the position of the live report.
[*] Added an internal parameter called hpstime. This allows to calculate the HPS based of the time you have been healing, while DPS can be calculated based on the time you did damage (In both instances its the time that passed between your first and last damage or healing respectively). In the live report window the bigger one of the two will be shown. In the main report the active time will reflect hpstime when a healing category is selected. This should also address an issue where refreshing path would cause your dps to lower at the end of the fight despite nothing really happening anymore.

0.8.1 541,878 (12.03.2018) 22:48
[*] Added an option button to the side bar. For now it just has a shortcut to toggle IDs 
[*] Added tracking of Equip and Skillbars for future use.
[*] Several bug fixes introduced in 0.8.0

0.8.1.1 543,100 (12.03.2018) 23:56
[*] fixed wrong version numbers
[*] added internal override for Line-breaker debuff, to prevent calculation issues when it gets renamed by other addons.

0.8.1.2 551,076 (13.03.2018) 21:41
[*] Fixed tracking of Night Mother's Gaze for penetration stats
[*] Fixed an issue where the window position would sometimes not be saved when it was dragged around. 

0.8.1.3 553,007 (14.03.2018) 00:01
[*] Fixed an issue where loading of a fight could fail if a fight of the same date had been loaded already. (thx @Liko)

0.8.1.4 565,212 (16.03.2018) 00:18
[*] Fixed an issue that would cause an error message

0.8.1.5 578,871 (18.03.2018) 15:22

0.8.2.0 630,400 (18.04.2018) 23:17

[*] added a single target damage display to the live report window
[*] added an option to post DPS or HPS to the options menu on the main report (cogwheel)
[*] fixed an issue where debuffs that affected spell resistance weren't tracked properly when another addon changed their name
[*] added CombatMetrics Version to the info bar at the bottom
[*] some small improvements

0.8.2.1 656,599 (27.04.2018) 01:14
[*] Fix Resistance Values for Major Breech and Major Fracture
[*] Added a throttle to a function that can cause stutter on PTS
[*] Fixed an issue with vertical layout of Live Report Window
[*] Fixed an issue where Crown Store Poisons and normal ones where pooled together even though they stack
[*] Updated data for resistance debuffs on PTS to reflect changes to certain sets

0.8.2.2 679,378 (03.05.2018) 19:28
[*] reworked resource tracking algorithm. This means includes adding the ability to track dodge rolls and bashs. As a result now all resouce events that cannot be attributed to a source will be shown as "Unkown". Therefore resource consumption and regeneration is tracked more accurately now. Before those unattributed resource events were ignored. If you see anything suspicious there please let me know.
[*] Some minor code improvements

0.8.2.3 714,687 (21.05.2018) 16:09
[*]API Bump to Summerset (100023)

0.8.2.8 946,987 (21.08.2018) 23:54

[*] Fixed outdated API number in CombatMetricsFightData submodule
[*] Fixed an error that could occur when selecting a fight via the fight list panel

0.8.2.9 1,002,327 (18.09.2018) 22:27
[*] Improved performance for calculating fights massively. Thanks to ZOS for implementing a profiling tool with the Murkmire PTS that allowed me to identify a function where the calculation was slowed down. I wouldn't have found that without the tool.
[*] API Bump for Murkmire (100025)

0.8.2.10 1,067,304 (26.10.2018) 20:24
[*] Fixed tracking of Spell Strategist.

0.8.2.11 1,113,154 (10.11.2018) 21:23
[*] Added a temporary workaround for Spell Strategist. The uptime that is shown refers to the time when at least one buff/debuff is active. Since the buff can overlap with itself (for double bonus) briefly, the theoretical possible uptime would be above 100% (for mre on this see here: https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/443636/spell-strategist-stacking-when-soloing-a-single-target-bug-or-feature.
[*] Updated French localization. Thanks to @Floliroy
[*] Updated libraries and changed the way they are loaded. They are still embedded, but need to be activated in the addon list ingame. This requires to check the "Allow out of date add-ons" box.0.8.2.11 1,113,154 (10.11.2018) 21:23

0.8.2.12 1,120,978 (11.11.2018) 11:23

0.8.3 1,227,401 (06.01.2019) 18:52
[*] Fixed an issue, where some sources for Major & Minor Force were not recognized when calculating the critical damage bonus stat. [thx @SnakE for reporting this)

0.8.4 1,298,832 (22.01.2019) 00:52
[*]API Bump to Wrathstone (100026)
[*]Reorganized bundled libraries (Make sure to activate them in the Addon Panel). This should fix a lua error some received.

0.9.0 1,509,277 (13.05.2019) 22:06
[*] API Bump to Elsweyr (100027)
[*] Added a new Info panel. It shows the Equipment, CP, and Skills used in the selected fight.
[**] For the skill panel "Weaving Metrics" are shown. They give some info how fast you are able to cast subsequent abilities and the average time between two subsequent casts of the same ability.
[**] Also some stats about how much time was spent and how much damage was done on each bar are shown. Werewolf is not supported at the moment but will be added in the future.
[*] Added a new Graph panel.
[**] Here you can view how DPS or HPS developed over time. You can also show Resources (e.g. Magicka) or Stats (e.g. Spell Damage).
[**] You can click on the colour boxes on the left to change the colours of the plots.
[**] When you select buffs/debuffs in the buff panel, while the graph panel is shown, the buff uptime will also be visualized in the graph.
[**] By drawing a rectangle you can zoom in, a right click resets the zoom.
[**] You can also activate a cursor with a tooltip that shows the exact numbers. It can be toggled on an off using the icon next to the enlarge button.
[*] Note that some of the new features only work for new fights.
[*] Elsweyr only: Added Overheal to healing category. All heal values will generally refer to effective (i.e. actually HP restoring) heal. Overheal and the absolute heal (i.e. effective + overheal) can be viewed in the healing category of the big fight report. Let me know if you need a display on the livereport, I could add it if necessary.
[*] Uptime % in the (De-)Buffs Out Panel are now considered towards the total time the respective units have been engaged in combat. This should lead to more reasonable results when you fight different bosses in succession (e.g. the iterations of Z'Maja in Cloudrest). It won't however help for fights where units are inactive in between (e.g. The minibosses in Asylum)
[*] When in a healing category, the "(De-)buffs out" panel now also considers the uptime of yourself
[*] Some of the columns in the abilities panel can now be changed. They are coloured in a bright yellow. You can for example choose to show the minimum hit instead of the maximum or show the average critical hit instead of the overall average hit. Just try them out!
[*] Added more options in the Combat Log. This includes Skill activations and for boss fights the remaining %HP.
[*] Added accountname to the bottom info bar
[*] Added a feedback/donation entry to the options menu on the fight report window, providing convenient access to give feedback in case you have suggestions or issues to report.
[*] Added an option to go to the addon settings from the options menu on the fight report window.
[*] Right click is no longer used to reset the selection in the different list panels, instead this is now set to the 3rd mouse button. 
[*] Added an option to post DPS/HPS to a selection of targets. When posting data for one unit only, the name of that unit is shown.
[*] When right clicking a unit while in the DPS out panel, you can now post the DPS to that unit or all units that share that name. Big Thanks to @Letho for the idea and help with this.
[*] Added an option to post Buff uptime (right click on buff).
[*] Buff uptime from the "(De-)buffs out" panel can also be directly posted for all bosses or group members without the need to select them in the unit panel first
(Note: You can also just click on a single unit to select it and then click again on it to deselect it)
[*] Added detection for Khajit Passive and Minor Force from the 5 pc bonus of Tzogvin’s Warband to show correct Critical Damage Modifier values. Please let me know if anything is missing there.
[*] Added a fix for issues with Briarheart and similar buffs.
[*] Updated french localization (Thx @Floliroy).
[*] Updated russian localization (Thx @KiriX). Note: This was done for the previolus version, so some translations will still be  missing.
[*] Updated Libraries. Added LibFeedback.
